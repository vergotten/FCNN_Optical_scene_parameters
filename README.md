# Recovery of Optical Parameters Using FCNN

This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Recovery of optical parameters of a scene using fully convolutional neural networks" by Maksim Sorokin, Dmitry Zhdanov, and Andrey Zhdanov from ITMO University, St. Petersburg, Russia.

## Description

The project focuses on the use of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) to recover the position and optical parameters of light sources in a scene. This is particularly relevant for virtual and augmented reality systems, where the accurate representation of lighting conditions is crucial for creating a natural and immersive experience.

## Usage/Examples

Usage examples are structured as notebooks. 

## Achieved results:
